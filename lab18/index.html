				<h2> Challenge </h2>
				<p> This lab's challenge was to use css to create a responsive layout webpage.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="problem">
			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p>I really struggled with this lab. I knew creating webpages before that responsive webpages was going to be the most difficult for me to do. I think I would benefit from watching someone create a responsive site. I think that I have developed bad habits from previous labs with layout. </p>

		<div class="results">
				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> I was able to create a webpage that is viewable on desktop, tablet and phones alike.</p>
