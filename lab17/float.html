			<h2> Challenge </h2>
			<p> This labs challenge was to use css to layout our webpage using float, flexbox, and grid.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="problem">
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>This lab was the hardest lab so far! I am used to laying out my webpages in absolute positions. The float method wasn't too bad because that's how I initially did the labs. However, flexbox and grid gave me a run for my money. Flexbox was difficult for me because I put my sections in boxes but getting the boxes to sit next to each other was difficult to figure out. The grid layout was hardest for me. I thought I understood how to do it. I even put my code into w3schools and it totally worked. But I couldn't get it to work once in my browser. I am unsure why. My partner and I messed with it a long time and couldn't figure it out. </p>

	<div class="results">
			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, edit margins and padding, position the photos, applied text-shadow, box-shadow, gradient, object fit and transformed photos. I was able to recreate my page using the four layout techniques.</p>
