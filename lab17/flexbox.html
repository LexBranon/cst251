					<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p> This labs challenge was to use advanced css to do fancy stuff and things.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="problem">
				<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p>This lab was much easier for me compared to the last one. I was already using box shadow, transform, text-shadow and rounded corner in other labs so that was a good refresher. The hardest part for me was the filters. They confused me because some were precentages, some decimals, and some degrees.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="results">
					<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, edit margins and padding, position the photos, applied text-shadow, box-shadow, gradient, filters, rounded corners, object fit and transformed photos.</p>

<p> "But all our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy—serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth."<br> <br> - Ta-Nehisi Coates </p>
