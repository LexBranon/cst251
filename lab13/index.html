					<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p> This labs challenge was to improve our webpage layout designs by utilizing block level styling.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="problem">
				<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p>This lab was pretty straight forward for me. The biggest problem that I had was trying to figure out float. It had worked for me in the past but for some reason wasn't in this lab. I finally figure out that it was because I needed it to display as inline-block.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="results">
					<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, center text, center an image, float text right, and "crop" an image using overflow .</p>
