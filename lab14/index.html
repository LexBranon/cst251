					<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p> This labs challenge was to recreate a webpage of our choice.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="problem">
				<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p>This lab was harder for me! But I think I learned a lot about how to arrange elements so that they sit in the position I want them. That being said, I am worried about my current real life capabilities. I think that the webpage would not be very responsive, and layout would be very dependent on what you are viewing it on. But maybe thats something to learn later. My main problems were in finding the right fonts. It was really hard to find one close that was free and a google font.</p>
