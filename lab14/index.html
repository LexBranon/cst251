				<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p>I thought this lab was going to be easier for me since I had a better understanding from doing lab 13, however, it was still difficult. I kept running into issues with the heading. For some reason it would not position corrently. I finally changed the background color of all my elements so I could see what was going on. I realized that I had positioned them all absolute and forgot to specify margins of a couple of the elements, including my heading which was running into other margins. Sadly, it took my 500 attempts of other things to figure that out. One thing I am still confused on is the usage of div that was div#_____ img for example vs div#______. </p>
