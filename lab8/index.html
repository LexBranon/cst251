			<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p> This lab was more difficult. I struggled with creating the correct divs and styling them. After lots of edits and messing around with the css, the site came out how I wanted it to. However, I wanted the three images at the bottom to be sized differently. I am unsure how to do that because even with seperate divs, the only way I could edit the size of the photos was to edit it as an img tag. Therefore, editting all of the photos. </p>
			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, change fonts and colors, and made the return home a button, and center the photos.</p>
