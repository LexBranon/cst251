			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> We had a pretty easy time with this lab. The CSS was already linked, which I think helped a lot. Image linking we have done on everhy lab now so that was pretty simple. On the last lab, we created a link back to the homepage so that was also simple to recreate. I also played around with css a bit. I had trouble with the background colors when I put in for example "cream" as the color. But I solved this by using hex codes.   </p>
			<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> You can now click a link to "return to homepage", my body content is wrapped in a div, my css stylesheet is linked, added forms. </p>
			<h2> Forms </h2>
				<form action="https://google.com/search" method="GET" target="_blank">
				  Your full name: <input type="text" name="q"/>
