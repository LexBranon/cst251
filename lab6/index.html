	<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
		<div id="content">

				<p> The idea of this lab was to introduce ID and class elements. It was also to demonstrate that we could link our CSS stylesheets. </p>
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> We had a pretty easy time with this lab. The CSS was already linked, which I think helped a lot. Image linking we have done on everhy lab now so that was pretty simple. On the last lab, we created a link back to the homepage so that was also simple to recreate.  </p>
			<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> You can now click a link to "return to homepage", my body content is wrapped in a div, my css stylesheet is linked. </p>
