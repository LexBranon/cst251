				<h2> Challenge </h2>
				<p> The challenge was to mess around with css. We experimented with margins, padding, adding content divs, adding borders, changing color of our body and divs, and styling images. </p>

			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p>I was expecting to run into lots of issues with this lab, considering last lab was hardest for me so far. However, this one went pretty smoothly. I think it was easier once I put everything in sepereate divs, whereas last time I was trying to style many objects at once in css. I think it also helped thinking about a website as lots of boxes.</p>

				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, change fonts and colors, add borders, edit margins and padding, styled the return home a button with a hover, and position the photos.</p>
