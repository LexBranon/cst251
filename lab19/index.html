          <p> When you think of great places to view fall foliage, California is probably not the first state that comes to mind. People typically head Back East to witness New England’s dramatic display, but there is no reason to hop on a plane and battle the “leafer” crowds; California fall color does exist!</p>
					<p> There are few places in California more beautiful than the Eastern Sierra in the fall. Quaking aspens flanking June Lake seem to glow as the sunlight penetrates their leaves. There is just something about the granite covered mountainside reflecting in the lake with fiery trees highlighting the foreground that keeps drawing people back to June Lake year after year.</p>
					<p> Mid-September is the time of year to begin your California fall color hunt in the High Sierras. You can view the vibrant fall foliage near Lake Sabrina, North Lake, and South Lake. These spots are located west of Bishop in Inyo County, just off Highway 168. </p>

									<h2> Challenge </h2>
									<p> This lab's challenge was to use css to create a responsive layout webpage using Bootstap.</p>

								<br>
								<h2> Problems </h2>
								<p>I didn't have very many issues with this lab. The bootstrap made it really easy to adapt. I had some issues with the background color for the header. But with changes to width I got it to look how I wanted it. Image size took me a bit to figure out too because I couldnt figure out how to keep them within the column if I made them larger. </p>

									<h2> Results </h2>
									<p> I was able to create a webpage that is viewable on desktop, tablet and phones using bootstrap.</p>
