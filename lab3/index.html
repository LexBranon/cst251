	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to futher create a local file structure on my computer and as index.html files. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> We had a pretty easy time creating links to our files. However, we ran into the issue of out links appearing as links on our sites but when we clicked them they didn't go to anything. We tried changing the directions of the link many times but still it wasn't working. Finally, after lots of overlooking we realized that on my href I had forgot the = sign. After fixing this, the links worked. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> Now, when you go to my index page, there is an image. In addition, there is a bulletted list that contains links to each of my labs. </p>
