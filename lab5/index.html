	<h2>Challenges</h1>
		<p>I had challenges deciding how I wanted my lab setup. So I had to play around alot with layout. I changes the heading sizes a lot. I also initially had a problem because I knew how to create a link to a site, and how to add an image. But thinking an image to a site was new to me. I utilized Aimee's help and w3schools and was able to figure it out. My images were broken at first, but I realized I had forgotten to add "".png" to them.</p>
	<h2>Results</h1>
		<p>I am pleased with how it came out. I wish that the layout was "prettier" but I added as much layout formatting I could while still using HTML and not CSS yet. I think once we get into CSS this could be a fun lab to go back and reformat.</p>
