			<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> This lab was a little bit more difficult. I struggled at first to create the files correctly. I created a new "index.html" and it ended up overwriting my homepage index page. So luckily I was able to revert to my previous and fix that. Otherwise, it just took a lot of tweaking the colors, div heights, etc. to get the webpage closer to how I wanted it to look.   </p>
			<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, change fonts and colors, and made the return home a button. </p>
