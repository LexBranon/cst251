One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome cut in half.</p> <br>

		</div>
		<div class="problem">
			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p>This lab took me longer than usual. I think it was just harder for me to figure out how I wanted to set up the webpage. I did a lot of research on transitions and animations to come up with ideas. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="results">
				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> I was able to create the file directory correctly, create divs, link my css file, edit margins and padding, position the photos, applied text-shadow, box-shadow, gradient, filters, animations, and tranformations.</p>
